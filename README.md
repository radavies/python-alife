# python-alife
Some kind of alife sim eventually...not sure exactly yet.

Currently implementing some ideas from the Primer YouTube channel's videos (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ) to get me started.

Runs the simulation and then graphs the results using Plotly. Might do some real time graphs later.

Note: You need to install https://github.com/plotly/orca before running.
